# Prediction-and-Optimization-of-3D-Printing-Parameters-Using-Machine-Learning
This project applies machine learning techniques using Python to predict and optimize key 3D printing parameters — nozzle diameter, nozzle temperature, and print speed — to minimize stress levels in additive-manufactured Polylactic Acid (PLA) biomaterials.
